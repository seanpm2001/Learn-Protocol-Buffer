* For: seanpm2001/Learn-Protocol-Buffer"
* About:"
* I decided to make Protocol Buffer the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-Protocol-Buffer) as Protocol Buffer is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Protocol Buffer programming language. It only makes sense to Protocol Buffer the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here."
